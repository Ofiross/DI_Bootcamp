        <h1>IRON-MAN</h1>
        <p>
            Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the
            former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius,
            billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark
            was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy
            lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet
            of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his
            captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah
            Stane who turned against Stark. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to
            share it with the world, publicly revealing himself as Iron Man.
